# Simple Scheduling

## Consideration & implementation

The Simple Scheduling have implemented under DropWizard in order to manage the Request using JSON format. I decided that implementation, because I think is a better approach for RestApi over Java technologies.

Other consideration assumed by me. it's using the Facade pattern to get the services. That approach enables the information for Student and Class. In addition, it's possible has available the current information on the services class.
